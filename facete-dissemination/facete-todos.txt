Unclassified:
- Improve table colors
	Note: This is just about adding the twitter bootstrap 'striped' class to the table.
- Implement the "Portlet-Theme" from the LOD2 Widget Choreography
	Note: This would give us much more flexibility in arranging the user interface components, such as hiding the table view and showing bookmarked facets instead.

Urgent:
- Finalize how to do the initial configuration (currently its all in src/main/webapp/js/main-facets.js) [DONE]
- Make the SPARQL endpoint / default graph selector actually work. [DONE]
- Make table headings show the facet name
- improve the widget for value selection of facets
	Note: This is about showing the facet value widget directly below the selected facet rather than at the bottom of the facet tree. However, positioning might be quite tricky.
- Creation and integration of static pages: FAQ, HowToUse, Further Information (Contact / Project Page / Maintainer)
	Note: The HowToUse will be based on Karel's guide.
- Show note on empty tables/lists


High:
- Support configuration of presets (so that users can pick from pre-configured settings - and we can preconfigure for the portal)
- Fix an issue resulting in duplicate results also also has negative performance impact [DONE]
- Fix an issue with incorrectly shown sub facets shown when a parent facet is constrained [DONE]
- Fix an issue with only one out of multiple facet linked to the map being shown
- Make a click on a map marker constrain the table to values for this location [DONE]
- Fix a bug seemingly related to a race condition when selecting markers on the map [NEW]
- Fix a bug with facets' checkboxes not being shown selected when selecting markers on the map [NEW]
	- This is due to an object not being normalized and thus failing an equals comparision.
- Show how many resources could NOT be shown on the map
- Add support for allowing users to load preconfigured views [NEW]

Medium:
- Finalize the integration of the facete-server module [DONE]
- Add support for setting the colors of the map markers
- Make the table support copying (e.g. for copying into excel)
- Make the facet values appear below the corresponding facet - rather than at the bottom of the tree
- Enable sorting facet values by their checked state
- Add export/import functionality for the state of the application
  - Enable importing the state from URL query string arguments

Low:
- Add support for choosing the number of items to be shown in the tables
- Add summary text for how many items there are in the table
- Show the facet value counts
- Indicate which facets actually carry geo-spatial information
- Enable rearranging table columns
- Support more complex color assignments (e.g. courts having sent documents to

Future:
- Support aggregates (SUM, COUNT, etc)
- Support grouping facet values into arbitrary hierarchies
- ... more stuff ...
