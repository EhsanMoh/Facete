Unclassified:
- Improve table colors
	Note: This is just about adding the twitter bootstrap 'striped' class to the table.
- Implement the "Portlet-Theme" from the LOD2 Widget Choreography
	Note: This would give us much more flexibility in arranging the user interface components, such as hiding the table view and showing bookmarked facets instead.
- Show the number of items that could not be displayed on the map


- Probably use "Items" instead of "Individuals"
- Welcome page
  - Three column layout, label them as (1) (2) (3) (left to right workflow)
  - (1) Select individuals, (2) Select filters, (2) Table of selected individuals, (3) Selected indviduals on the map, Selected indidivuals below- Big overall box -> Big button "Explore a dataset" -> Click gives the actual application
  - 1 Page, not too fancy - set the mind for the user (Make it close to what it is - but mainly for feedback - having it is important, as it tackles "I don't understand it)
- How to organize functionality to feel more
  - Replace "root" with "Individuals" ->
- Inteface of the tree selection is hard to deal with:
  - Erogonics of the icons are really small -> Settings: Font size drop down
  - Separate functionality: Creation of the table with the items of interest from placing them on the map
  - The globe symbol would be best replaced with a new widget: "Place your selected items of the map using the coordinates of these".
  - (Limits to the components -> We probably would need to add some "Search for more, search longer" button)
    - Best efforts to find something that could be used. In the worst case show a hint"
- Click e.g. the globe twice, or in the geo-widget: Add a button to filter by map. Special filter: Select all items that have lat/long.
  - Ping the dataset whether there is geo-data, if not, we could hide the map, and have a popup message saying that the map was disabled because there was nothing to show.
- For incompleteness: Split of a comlex path into individual steps, and debug like this.
  - With order by functionality we would sort the table by which items are null, e.g. not interlinked.
- Colors really would be cool :)
  - 1 deliverable in the short term -> fixes: design, ie7 crash, larger dataset, individual detail pages

Note:
- Karel already created a mockup of the welcome page. After 15th: Clarify updated functionality of the widgets.
- PING and SPATIAL WIDGET are most important elements, but also ORDERING OF THE TABLE.
- Meeting with PO this friday (5th July).


Urgent:
- Finalize how to do the initial configuration (currently its all in src/main/webapp/js/main-facets.js) [DONE]
- Make the SPARQL endpoint / default graph selector actually work. [DONE]
- Make table headings show the facet name
- improve the widget for value selection of facets
	Note: This is about showing the facet value widget directly below the selected facet rather than at the bottom of the facet tree. However, positioning might be quite tricky.
- Creation and integration of static pages: FAQ, HowToUse, Further Information (Contact / Project Page / Maintainer)
	Note: The HowToUse will be based on Karel's guide.
- Show note on empty tables/lists


High:
- Support configuration of presets (so that users can pick from pre-configured settings - and we can preconfigure for the portal)
- Fix an issue resulting in duplicate results also also has negative performance impact [DONE]
- Fix an issue with incorrectly shown sub facets shown when a parent facet is constrained [DONE]
- Fix an issue with only one out of multiple facet linked to the map being shown
- Make a click on a map marker constrain the table to values for this location [DONE]
- Fix a bug seemingly related to a race condition when selecting markers on the map [NEW]
- Fix a bug with facets' checkboxes not being shown selected when selecting markers on the map [NEW]
	- This is due to an object not being normalized and thus failing an equals comparision.
- Show how many resources could NOT be shown on the map
- Add support for allowing users to load preconfigured views [NEW]

Medium:
- Finalize the integration of the facete-server module [DONE]
- Add support for setting the colors of the map markers
- Make the table support copying (e.g. for copying into excel)
- Make the facet values appear below the corresponding facet - rather than at the bottom of the tree
- Enable sorting facet values by their checked state
- Add export/import functionality for the state of the application
  - Enable importing the state from URL query string arguments

Low:
- Add support for choosing the number of items to be shown in the tables
- Add summary text for how many items there are in the table
- Show the facet value counts [DONE]
- Show number of items in the table
- Indicate which facets actually carry geo-spatial information
- Enable rearranging table columns
- Support more complex color assignments (e.g. courts having sent documents to

Future:
- Support aggregates (SUM, COUNT, etc)
- Support grouping facet values into arbitrary hierarchies
- ... more stuff ...
