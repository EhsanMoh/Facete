<b>Functionality</b>
<ul><li dir="ltr">Restore filters selection
</li><li dir="ltr">Restore pivoting (i.e. navigation along facets)
</li><li dir="ltr">Finish initial class selection (i.e. user can chose "Commitments" as a starting point)
</li><li dir="ltr">Enable the user to chose focus, navigation and geo path
</li><li dir="ltr">Add statistics support: In a first version it would probably be sufficient if
</li><li dir="ltr">Include additional information (besides lat/long/zoom) in PermaLink:
<ul><li dir="ltr">Selected facets
</li><li dir="ltr">Initial concept (e.g. the "Commitments" class)
</li><li dir="ltr">Focus/Navigation/Geo path
</li><li dir="ltr">Custom Data-bindings (i.e. facet values to: charts, or size and color of markers 
</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">On mouse-over over a focused resource, show* and highlight all related geo-locations on the map
<ul><li dir="ltr">These markers should be independent of the facet selection
</li><li dir="ltr">However, we could add a toggle whether facet constraints should apply - e.g. if there was a constraint on beneficiary)
</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Add support for showing focused resources for which there does not exist a geo-location</li></ul>

<b>Layout &amp; Styling</b>
<ul><li dir="ltr">Show the selected facet constraints in a nice way
<ul><li dir="ltr">Not sure if the location above the map is the best place for them; we could make
</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">There is a layout glitch where the sizes of the tab content become wrong and scrollbars appear - however, on window resize this disappears again.
</li><li dir="ltr">Initially, the facet tabs for incoming/outgoing only show content after switching tabs first
</li><li dir="ltr">Position the fact box nicely
</li><li dir="ltr">Position the instance list nicely
</li><li dir="ltr">Make items for which information is displayed in the factbox appear in bold
</li><li dir="ltr">Instead of plain markers, use ones with e.g. alphabetical letters; which are also shown at the corresponding instances (so make it a bit google maps like)</li></ul>

<b>Interlinking</b>
<ul><li dir="ltr">City level: Disambiguate cases where one city is linked to many locations
</li><li dir="ltr">Address level:
<ul><li dir="ltr">Convert all geocoded data to RDF
</li><li dir="ltr">And also disambiguate cases where one city is linked to many locations</li></ul></li></ul>

<b>Additional</b>
<ul><li dir="ltr">Add support for polygons: (This can be seen a registering a projection to the current query)
<ul><li dir="ltr">Currently not really relevant to ODP, but needed for LinkedGeoData</li></ul></li></ul>


<b>Brief overview of the core concepts of SemMap</b>
SemMap makes use of the following concepts:
<ul><li dir="ltr">Concept: This is a (graph-pattern, variable) pair, such as ({ ?s a Commitment}, ?s). It describes an initial set of resources
</li><li dir="ltr">Focus path: Based on the concept, a focus path leads from the concept-variable to a different set of variables, for which information should be displayed. Usually it is empty, which means that the focus resources are the ones identified by the concept.
</li><li dir="ltr">Geo-path: The path from the concept to the geo-resources. As such we can add geo-constraints (e.g. bounding box) on it.
</li><li dir="ltr">Navigation path: The path the user navigated along by following the properties of the resources. The facets presented to the user are those that apply to the current set of resources the user navigated to. The count of each facet shows, how many corresponding resources there are on the focus path.
<ul><li dir="ltr">This means: If the concept is  ({ ?s a Commitment}, ?s), the focus path empty, and the navigation path is "beneficiary" then:<br> The user sees the facets of beneficiaries, but the facet counts show, how many commitments there are.</li></ul></li></ul>
